Install Docker on my machine.

Create a directory for my Kafka and Zookeeper configuration files:
mkdir kafka-zookeeper
cd kafka-zookeeper

Create a docker-compose.yml file in the directory with the following content:
version: '2'

networks:
  kafka-net:

services:
  zookeeper:
    image: 'bitnami/zookeeper:latest'
    networks:
      - kafka-net
    environment:
      - ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN=yes

  kafka:
    image: 'bitnami/kafka:latest'
    networks:
      - kafka-net
    environment:
      - KAFKA_CFG_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181
      - ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes

I Saved the file and start the cluster using the following command:
docker-compose up -d

Then a Zookeeper instance and a Kafka instance using the Bitnami images were started. The following messages showed on my terminal:
[+] Running 2/2

 - Container kafka-zookeeper-kafka-1      Started

To check if the cluster is running properly, I use the following command to list the running containers:
docker ps

It shows the below:
